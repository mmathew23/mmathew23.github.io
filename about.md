This is my personal website and yes, it's true, my name is indeed Mathew Mathew. Fun fact, there exist websites that prevent a copy paste of first and last name during account registration. Gmail is probably the most famous example, where I couldn't create an account with my real name when I first signed up. :-) 

I received an undergrad degree from Washington University in St. Louis and shortly after obtained a Master's of Science in Financial Engineering from Baruch College's Department of Mathematics. This was much more an applied mathematics degree than a finance one. 

After the master's program, I landed at JP Morgan in their Securitized Product Group as an applications developer. As I left I responsible for all the analytics the MBS/ABS traders received in the morning. These reports were required to be delivered every morning and impacted trading decisions for the day.

Later, I arrived at State Street Bank as a Quantitative Researcher. I worked my way up to Vice President and was in charge of the risk analytics from all of our Fixed Income models. We processed analytics daily for trillions of dollars of assets under management, and had to support various clients from pension funds to major central banks.

As my job moved more into a management role, I had the itch to build again. My wife and I moved to Chicago, where my startup Travelnami was born. I raised a small amount of funding, built an MVP, iterated on the solution, but ultimately decided to shutdown when covid hit.

Since then I've focused my efforts on AI. It's the future afterall. I spent time researching on my own, and landed a contract doing texture synthesis research. I built a proof of concept to expand, compress, and remix textures with high fidelity. 

Outside of AI, I enjoy learning how to smoke the best brisket possible, pour over coffees and random DIY hacks.
