This is my personal website, and I know what you're thinking. Yes! My name is certainly Mathew Mathew. Fun fact: websites exist that prevent a copy-paste of first and last names during account registration. Gmail is the most famous example where I couldn't create an account with my real name when I first signed up. :laughing:

I received an undergrad degree from Washington University in St. Louis. I shortly after obtained a Master of Science in Financial Engineering from Baruch College's Department of Mathematics to get into the quantitative side of finance. However, the degree focused much more on math than finance and served me well as I ventured into other applications of mathematics.

After the master's program, I landed an applications developer role at JP Morgan in their Securitized Product Group. Remember the subprime mortgage crisis involving mortgage and asset-backed securities (MBS/ABS)? I started during the aftermath, and as I left, I was responsible for all the analytics the MBS/ABS traders received in the morning. These reports were required to be delivered every morning and impacted daily trading decisions.

Later, I arrived at State Street Bank as a Quantitative Researcher. I worked my way up to Vice President and was in charge of the risk analytics for all of our Fixed Income models. We processed analytics daily for trillions of assets under management and supported various clients, from pension funds to major central banks.

As my job moved more into a management role, I had the itch to build again. So my wife and I moved to Chicago, where my startup Travelnami was born. I raised a small amount of funding, created an MVP, and iterated on the solution, but ultimately decided to shut down when covid hit.

Since then, I've focused my efforts on AI. It's the future, after all. So I spent time researching independently and landed a contract doing texture synthesis research. Then, using learnings from my investigation, I built an MVP to expand, compress, remix, and blend textures with high fidelity.

Outside AI, I enjoy learning to smoke the best brisket possible, make pour-over coffees, and execute random DIY hacks.
